<h1>Types of Operators</h1>
Unary Operators -> Takes one operand: -5 +3

Binary Operators -> 3 + 5 ; a = b
  
Ternary Operators -> (boolean-expression) ? expression1 : expression2

 -- If the boolean condition is true, expression1 is the result
 -- If the boolean condition is false, then expression2 is the result
 
 <b>All binary operators except assignment operator are left-associative</b>

Problem sequence:

1. Understand what the problem is asking for
2. Identify and implement the algorithm
3. Code

<h2>Instance vs Static Methods</h2>

- Instance methods can only be invoked by using a specific instance/object
- A static method can be invoked without using an object
