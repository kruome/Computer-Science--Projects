Question 1. (20 Points) Create a struct to build a linked list and call it Node, the struct consist of an integer data field, a self-referential pointer, and a constructor for initializing the struct members. 
Question 2. (40 Points) Based on Question 1 struct, Define a function for searching the list (int search(Node* head, int x)), the function shall return the position of a number x on the list. The first node in the list is at position 0, the second node is at position 1, and so on. If x is not found on the list, the search should return -1. Test the new member function using an appropriate driver program.
Question 3. (10 Points) Based on Question 1 struct, write a function (call it countNodes) that counts and returns the number of nodes in the list. Given a linked list A = (0, 5, 10, -1, 4), the function void countNodes(Node * head) shall print  5.
